## Used framework ⚙️
DRY used here 😐

## Idea 💡

Someday I just delete my Windows Calculator in some accident.(Seriously!🤣🤣🤣)
So, I had two choices. Reinstall Windows Calculator or create own Calculator. You figure out what happened next. 🤣🤣🤣


### Install 💾
Without unnecessary text:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```

### What next ❓:

I think I'm probably still support this small calculator for yourself.
To be done:
* Modal info about stop divide by 0,
* Now allow to add 0 in as first number in int number,
* History of last 10 calculate,
* What you offer 🙏
